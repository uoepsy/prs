Welcome to Practical Research Skills, a workbook created by staff and students at the University of Edinburgh's School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences. This resource aims to support our undergraduates in carrying out their first research projects. Using the menu above, you can find a set of videos and practical materials that provide a knowledge base for how to get research done. From coming up with a research design to applying for ethical review, this resource will teach you how to be a psychological scientist.
