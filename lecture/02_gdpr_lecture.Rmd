# Managing your data under the General Data Protection Regulations

# What is GDPR?

## General Data Protection Regulations

- A set of EU regulations on how individuals and organizations collect and process concerning people.
- World's strictest privacy standards.

- Post-Brexit, subsumed into UK law as the Data Protection Act 2018.
- If an organization wants to work with an EU partner, it must follow GDPR.

# Different types of data under GDPR

### **Data**

- Any information collected about or from an individual (e.g., a response time).

### **Personal Data**

- Information about an individual that allows them to be identified (e.g., a name).

### **Sensitive Personal Data**

- Information about an individual that identifies certain protected characteristics, such as:
    + Race & ethnicity
    + Political opinions
    + Physical or mental health
    + and more...

# Why are data types important?

### **Collecting different types of data requires different levels of justification**

- Providing personal data could risk the privacy of your participant.
    + But as a *reseacher* you have a legal justification to collect that data, and become its **controller**.

<br>

- Providing sensitive personal data could put your participants at *risk*.
    + Thus, you must have a significant research justification for collecting that data.
    
<br>    
**Key implication:** Only collect the data that you really need, and ensure that that data is kept securely.

# What does it mean to keep data secure?

**Stored in a GDPR-approved location**
- For physical data: A locked filing cabinet in a locked room in your supervisor's laboratory.
- For electronic data: Your University OneDrive account, or within a password-protected Microsoft Teams group with your supervisor and collaborators.
    + *Not* in your personal dropbox or Google accounts.
    
**Locked with protective passwords**
- Never leave personal data open. Make sure your laptop has a password. Don't bring printouts to a cafe.

**Make data non-personal**
- *Anonymize* your data by removing identifying information. Anonymized data can be safely shared.
- Remember, identifying information can be subtle, like a University s-number.

# Data subject rights

Personal data that you collect is not strictly *yours.* It belongs to the subject collected from, and they have certain rights.

- **Right to be forgotten.** Subjects can request their data be erased.
- **Right to object.** Subjects can object to how their data is used.
- **Right to restrict processing.** Subjects can stop you processing their data.

And more, see [university data policy](https://www.ed.ac.uk/data-protection/data-subject-rights)

# Practical implications

### **1. Plan for your data. **
Consider what data, personal data, and sensitive personal data you need to collect. You will need to justify this when you apply for ethical approval in a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).

### **2. Design your consent form right**
The PPLS ethics portal contains example consent forms that will help you appropriately tell participants what data you will collect, and how they can contact you.

### **3. Plan for data storage**
Remember that you need secure and flexible storage, that will allow you to safely secure sensitive data, and process it when needed.
