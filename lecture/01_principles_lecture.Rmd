# Respect for persons

### What does it mean to conduct research based on respect for individuals?

- If a doctor were to ask you to take part in a medical study, what would you want to know ahead of time?

<br> 

### A key marker of respect for persons is *informed consent*

- Full disclosure of all information, including risk and benefits

- Listing of the obligations and responsibilities of both parties

# Social responsibility

.pull-left[
### Justice 

Ethically assigning the burdens as well as the benefits of research.

- Imagine: *A study to train working memory in children...*

- How do you ethically assign children to Test and Control groups?

### Trust

Ensuring your participants' participation and data are protected.

- For example, keeping data *Confidential* versus *Anonymous*

- *Confidential data.* Identity of the participant is stored by the researcher, but cannot be accessed by others.

- *Anonymous data.* Identity of the participant is not even known by researcher.

# Maximising benefit and minimising harm

### Do good, and do no harm 

- The goal of minimising harm is why *deception* is typically frowned upon, and must be accompanied by a debrief.

# Fidelity and scientific integrity

Psychological science is a ** community ** exercise: Your participants, your collaborators, your readers and your peers.

Research misconduct harms all of these individuals.
